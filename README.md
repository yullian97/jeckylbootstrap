## WTF?

Jekyll is a simple and blog-aware static site generator built in Ruby. In laymen terms, it's just a tool to let you have **all the cool features of a full-blown CMS without having to worry about managing a database**. This means hosting is *extremely easy* and *scalable* since all you're doing is managing a bunch of files.

This is just a starter theme!
